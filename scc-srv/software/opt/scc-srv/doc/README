Description
===========
This file describes the server part of System Configuration Collector aka SCC.

Purpose
=======
The purpose of the SCC server is to combine configuration data from SCC clients and
provide summaries and a web-interface to search and compare configuration data.

Installation and operation
==========================
Refer to scc-srv(5) and http://sysconfcollect.sourceforge.net/architecture.html for details.
To access the manual page after installation, add /opt/scc-srv/man to $MANPATH.

Development and build
=====================
The remainder of this file describes the development environment of the SCC server.
Download and unpack the src.tar.gz for local developments.

Directories
===========
The development environment consists of the following directories:
- pkg_files	all files required during the production and installation of the software
- software	target for all packages that are produced
- test    	bats tests

The base directory contains the main scripts, pages and help pages of the server part of SCC.

Building
========
The source distribution of the software is produced by invoking the build script.
As this script requires root permissions, you can use sudo to activate it.
This source distribution is the base for the production of all other package formats.
They can be produced by invoking the build script with the --all option. This option
also requires root permissions. All produced packages can be found in the software 
subdirectory.

Testing
=======
Install bats:

	git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
	cd bats-core
	sudo ./install.sh /usr/local

Run all tests: sudo bats tests/
