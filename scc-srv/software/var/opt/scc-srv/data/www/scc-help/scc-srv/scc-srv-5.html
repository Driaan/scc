<H2> INTRODUCTION</H2>
<PRE>
       The complete functionality of the server part of SCC consists of:

       - receive files sent by scc from client systems
       - transfer of these files to the directory used by the web server
       - summarize data in the received files
       - allow search and compare functionality through a web server

       Refer to the manual pages of scc for details concerning the SCC client.


   Summary of transfer of SCC-data
       Basically there are three setups: push, pull and two-step.

       In  the	push  setup,  all  clients schedule scc with the -p and the -s
       options and transferred data is processed on scc-srv by means of sched-
       uled  invocations  of  <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A>.   This  setup requires (non-root)
       access of all clients to scc-srv, except when data is  transferred  via
       email.

       In  the pull setup, scc-srv schedules <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A> with the -R option to
       run the client, obtain the data and process the transferred data.  This
       setup  requires	superuser  access  from	 scc-srv  to  all  clients and
       involves all systems in a realm and all scc client  scripts  should  be
       accessible via the same path.  Note that scc-win clients do not support
       pulling scc data.

       In the two-step setup, all clients schedule scc	with  -p  pull	option
       without the -s option and scc-srv schedules <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A> with the -R and
       -n options to obtain and process the client data.  This setup  requires
       (non-root)  access from scc-srv to all clients and involves all systems
       in a realm and all scc client data should be accessible	via  the  same
       path.

       These three setups could be mixed on a realm basis.


   Summary of activation
       The  following  list  summarizes	 the steps to get scc-srv working.  We
       assume that SCC-data is transferred via email and that it is referenced
       by  a symbolic link from the document root of the web server.  When the
       snapshots are not transported via email, you can skip the corresponding
       steps.	Refer  to  the	remainder of this document for a more detailed
       description and other setups.

       1  activate the web server and email-processing
       2  install scc-srv
       3  extend the mail-alias file:
	     scc-transfer: "| /opt/scc-srv/bin/scc-receive-mail"
       4  activate the new alias:
	     newaliases
       5  determine the user and group used during the email delivery
	  and assign the proper ownership (assume mail:mail):
	     scc-update -m mail:mail
       6  test whether scc-setup is able to determine the proper defaults by means of:
	     scc-setup
	  optional set environment variables to supply the proper values and activate
	     scc-setup -a
       7  schedule scc-update to process incoming SCC-data, frequency depends
	  upon the amount of data and time of arrival of new SCC-data.
	     scc-update	   # no arguments/options required

       It is also possible to pull the scc-files from the clients after remote
       execution.   This avoids steps 3, 4, 5 and the scheduling of scc on the
       clients.	 Refer to the section "Pulling files  from  the	 clients"  for
       more details.


   Installation
       First of all we need a working scc server system.  Later we will need a
       client system to send its data through email, scp, ftp, rcp  or	cp  to
       the  server.   Install  scc-srv	with  your package management software
       according to the instructions on the download page of the website.

       This installs several programs in the directory /opt/scc-srv/bin , man-
       ual pages in /opt/scc-srv/man , documentation in /opt/scc-srv/doc and a
       directory tree under /var/opt/scc-srv/data.  To access  these  programs
       and manual pages, you can extend your PATH and MANPATH variables during
       the configuration phase.	 During "normal" operations, direct access and
       usage of the scc-server software is not required and the following set-
       tings are not necessary after the completion of the configuration.

	  PATH=${PATH}:/opt/scc-srv/bin
	  MANPATH=${MANPATH}:/opt/scc-srv/man
	  export PATH MANPATH


       When you want to install the software in	 another  directory,  download
       the  source tarball, customize and use the script "relocate" and gener-
       ate the appropriate depot/package/rpm.	The  source  tarball  contains
       scripts	to  generate all native install formats.  This can be achieved
       by unpacking the	 source	 tarball  and  adding/modifying	 the  required
       files.	Refer  to  the README file in the source tree for more details
       concerning producing the depot/rpm/package.

       The following paragraphs describe how the data-directory tree should be
       used to receive and transfer the files to their ultimate location.


   Receiving files
       When  the  scc  client  has  collected its data, it can send it through
       email, scp, ftp, rcp or cp.  The destination of the  files  depends  on
       the communication program:

	  - cp:	       &lt;directory&gt;
	  - ftp:       srv.dom:&lt;directory&gt;
	  - scp/rcp:   &lt;user&gt;@srv.dom:&lt;directory&gt;
	  - email:     &lt;user&gt;@srv.dom



   Receiving files using scp/rcp
       Suppose	you  decide  to	 send data from (some of) your systems to your
       scc-server by means of scp or rcp.  Your steps depend on the  way  file
       transfer	 between  systems in your network is done at the moment.  When
       all or most of your systems use scp of rcp for user root, the necessary
       key-files  and  rhost-files  are	 already  in  place.  Each transfer on
       behalf of scc from a client can use the existing communication path and
       has to specify the full path of the destination directory.

	  scc -p scp \
	      -s root@srv.dom:/var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/cp

       When you use several accounts to transfer files to your server, you can
       create  several	subdirectories	in  /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/cp,
       each owned by a specific user.

       Add  the	 proper key files or rhosts file to the home-directory of (for
       example) user scc to enable communication between the  client  and  the
       server.	Clients can now send the data using the following command:

	  /opt/scc/bin/scc -p scp -s scc@srv.dom:



   Receiving files using ftp
       Suppose you decide to send data from (some of) your systems with ftp to
       your scc-server.	 You have to create a  ~/.netrc	 file  containing  the
       data  of	 the account that receives the SCC-data.  The contents of this
       file are:

       machine &lt;scc-srv&gt; login &lt;account&gt; password &lt;password&gt;

       Make sure only root can read this file as it contains a plaintext pass-
       word.   This file can also be used with an anonymous ftp-server.	 It is
       obvious that you should not use the root-account of the	scc-server  in
       this file.  Use a separate account as described with the transfer using
       scp/rcp.


   Receiving files using email
       Suppose you decide to send data from (some of) your systems by email to
       your  scc-server.   We  have to extend the alias file on the scc-server
       with an alias that triggers a program that puts the email  contents  in
       the proper directory.  This program is <A HREF="scc-receive-mail.html">scc-receive-mail(1)</A>.  So, extend
       your aliases file with:

	  scc-transfer:	   "| /opt/scc-srv/bin/scc-receive-mail"

       The   default   destination   directory	 of   <A HREF="scc-receive-mail.html">scc-receive-mail(1)</A>   is
       /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/mail.   Another  directory can be speci-
       fied as an argument for <A HREF="scc-receive-mail.html">scc-receive-mail(1)</A>.   Do  not  forget  to  run
       newaliases to activate the new alias.

       To  reduce  the likelihood of DOS-attacks, you should use a non-obvious
       email-alias and not the alias from this documentation.

       We have to consider the following security aspects of programs  invoked
       through an email alias.	The program <A HREF="scc-receive-mail.html">scc-receive-mail(1)</A> runs under the
       uid/gid specified by the mail-handler.  On a vanilla RedHat system with
       sendmail,  this	is  mail/mail.	 The  destination  directory should be
       writable for this user.	The rpm for scc-srv sets the uid:gid for  this
       directory  to  root:root.   To  change  this, use the -m option of scc-
       update(1).

	  scc-update -m mail:mail

       Subsequent calls of <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A> do not need to specify this option.

       On some systems the smrsh option (sendmail restricted shell)  is	 acti-
       vated.	This  means  that  only	 programs  located  in	the  directory
       /etc/smrsh can be activated through an email alias.  When you  use  the
       smrsh  option,  you  have  to  add  some	 additional  programs  to this
       restricted shell environment:

	  cd /etc/smrsh
	  ln -s /opt/scc-srv/bin/scc-receive-mail scc-receive-mail
	  ln -s /bin/cat cat

       Modify the file sendmail.mc to alter this  option.   The	 program  scc-
       receive-mail(1)	is not complicated and only uses the program /bin/cat.
       Now clients can send their data to the scc-server  with	the  following
       command:

	  scc -s scc-transfer@srv.dom

       When  you use another mail-handler, like postfix, all you need to do is
       to determine the user:group that is used to run <A HREF="scc-receive-mail.html">scc-receive-mail(1)</A> and
       change the ownership for the transfer-directory with the -m option.


   Receiving files using email without MTA
       Contributed by David LeVene.

       Just  wanted  to share a way to allow scc to recevie via email, without
       running a MTA(sendmail/postfix).	 This can be due to  security  reasons
       eg. you don&#39;t want a host recieving email.

       1. Setup a mailbox (could be anywhere, even office365)
       2.  Configure  fetchmail	 to download mail from that client. This is an
       example config that will do the trick, for office365.

	 set daemon	   300		# Poll every 5 minutes, or configure via
					# cron if you want more control over the
					# exact timing.
	 set logfile scc-fetchmail.log	# Create a log to track stuff

	 poll outlook.office365.com proto imap
	   auth password
	   user &#39;username&#39;
	   pass &#39;password&#39; ssl
	   folder "Inbox/test"		# Folder to download email from
	   fetchall			# fetch everything, even read messages
	   nokeep			# Will delete the email after its been
					# downloaded. When testing.. perhaps
					# turn this off
	   mda &#39;/opt/scc-srv/bin/scc-receive-mail&#39;  # Send the email to the scc receiver

       You can test fetchmail and make it verbose via:
	 $ fetchmail -f /path/to/file/above -v

       3. Make sure you perform an scc-update -m fetchmail:group once
       4. Test sending an scc report via email
       5. Run scc-update to process the file which  is	sitting	 in  the  mail
       transfer directory (defaults to /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/mail)

       If  "other"  mail goes into this folder the scc-receive-mail just notes
       that there is no attachment it expects to see and moves on. eg:

       scc-transfer:  missing  scc-transfer-data  in  email:  file_6312	  from
       "host@somedomain.com"

       Use  the -k option for the client to encrypt the sensitive data of your
       systems when you use an external MTA.


   Receiving files using cp
       The destination has to be a directory on the client (and server).  This
       option can be used on the server and with NFS.


   Pulling files from the clients
       In  the case of password-less ssh/rsh communication from your server to
       clients, it is also possible to pull the scc-files  from	 the  clients.
       Use  <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A>	 to  start  scc	 on the clients and pull the resulting
       files to the server.  The program supports several options  controlling
       the  execution  on  the	clients.   It also supports several options to
       specify from which clients to pull the scc-files.  In it simplest form,
       the  program  can  be called without any options.  In that case, scc is
       executed in the background on all systems whose snapshot resides in the
       realm  All.   After waiting for 10 minutes, the scc-files are retrieved
       from all clients and scc-update is called to update the website.	  Con-
       sult the manual page of <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A> for the details.

       After installing scc on a new client, the system has to be added to the
       command-line of scc-pull.  When scc-pull uses the -R option to  process
       all systems from a realm, it has to be called manually once with the -S
       option to let the files become part of realm All.  Possibly you have to
       use  <A HREF="scc-realm.html">scc-realm(1)</A> to add the new system to the required realm.  Now the
       scc-files of the new client reside in the required realm and subsequent
       calls  of scc-pull will access the system.  Before using scc-pull for a
       new system, you should test the password-less  communication  from  the
       scc-srv to the new system.


   Combining push and pull
       Schedule scc on the clients and specify the -p pull option.  Now sched-
       ule <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A> on scc-srv and specify the -n option.  Make  sure  that
       <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A>  runs  after	 the  last client has finished.	 Otherwise the
       data of running clients are not transferred.


   Transfer of data to web server
       The data, that is sent by the scc-clients, ends up in directories  "cp"
       and  "mail" under /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer.  The files are packed
       by tar and compressed by gzip or compress.  Data sent by email is  also
       uuencoded.  The command <A HREF="scc-transfer.html">scc-transfer(1)</A> unpacks the data into files and
       transfers  them	to  the	 directory  /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/All  and
       assigns	the  proper  permissions  and ownership.  It is called by scc-
       update(1).

       The web server has to read the files.  Therefore we have to change  the
       ownership  of the files to the user that is used to run the web server.
       Use the -w option of <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A>  to  change  the  ownership  of  the
       directories and files.  For example:

	  scc-update -w apache

       Subsequent  calls  of <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A> do not need to specify this option.
       Now all html-files, snapshots, log files and summaries are  present  in
       the directory /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/All.

       The  summaries  of  the	runs  on the clients are generated by scc-sum-
       mary(1).	 The specification of the System Tools (required by <A HREF="scc-smt.html">scc-smt(1)</A>
       is  done	 by editing the file /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/All/custom/scc-
       smt-select Refer to the manual page of  <A HREF="scc-smt.html">scc-smt(1)</A>  for	more  details.
       The  specification of the rules for <A HREF="scc-rules.html">scc-rules(1)</A> is done by editing the
       file /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/All/custom/scc-rules.conf Refer  to  the
       manual page of <A HREF="scc-rules.html">scc-rules(1)</A> for more details.  These three programs are
       called by <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A>.

       Add <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A> to the root-crontab.  The time and  frequency	depend
       upon the time and frequency you use for running SCC on the clients.


   Transfer through a firewall
       When a group of systems is separated from scc-srv by a firewall, one of
       these client systems can act as a gateway for the transfer.  Only  this
       system requires an (ssh) allow rule in the firewall.

       Install	scc-srv	 on the gateway system and ignore the configuration of
       the web-part.  Make sure it contains the data of all of its&#39; local sys-
       tems.   Either  push data from the client to the gateway system or pull
       data from the clients to the gateway system.  In the latter  case,  use
       the  -U	option of scc-pull to avoid transferring the collected data to
       the web directory of scc-srv on	the  gateway  and  keep	 them  in  the
       data/transfer/cp directory.

       Now make sure that the main scc-srv collects the data of all firewalled
       clients via the gateway system by means of the following command:


	  scc-pull -n -L &lt;gateway_system&gt; -D /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/cp


       Note that this command runs on the main scc-srv. Refer  to  <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A>
       for  the used options.  As the local clients of the gateway system can-
       not be accessed directly by the main scc-srv, the -R option of scc-pull
       cannot be used for these systems.

       The above approach requires root access along the entire chain from scc
       clients, gateway scc-srv and  the  main	scc-srv.   When	 that  is  not
       feasable, a non-root account (say &#39;scc&#39;) can be used.

       Start with using the -u option for the client runs:


	 /opt/scc/bin/scc -u scc -d 3600  # default is -p pull


       The  following  command	on  the gateway scc-srv will access the client
       systems as user scc to retrieve the scc data and stores	the  files  in
       the (new) directory transfer/cp/scc:


	 /opt/scc-srv/bin/scc-pull				\
	     -F /home/scc/systems				\
	     -s /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/cp/scc		\
	     -n -u scc -O scc -I /home/scc/.ssh/id_rsa -o no_hosts


       The -O option implies the -U option and results in the ownership of the
       transferred files by user scc and now the main scc-srv can retieve  all
       files from the gateway scc-srv using the command:


	 /opt/scc/bin/scc-pull			       \
	     -D /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer/cp/scc  \
	     -n -L &lt;gateway_system&gt; -u scc -I /home/scc/.ssh/id_rsa -o no_hosts


       Note  that  this	 command runs on the main scc-srv and updates the sum-
       maries in the web-interface of scc-srv.

       Timing of the cronjobs on the clients, the gateway scc-srv and the  man
       scc-srv	should	be coordinated to ensure that all clients are finished
       before the gateway scc-srv pulls the  files  and	 that  all  files  are
       received	 by  the gateway scc-srv before the main scc-srv retrieves the
       files from the gateway scc-srv.

       The file /home/scc/systems can be managed from  the  main  scc-srv  via
       <A HREF="scc-realm.html">scc-realm(1)</A>  using  the -l option when the involved client systems are
       combined in a separate, dedicated realm.	 The resulting data from  this
       command	can be copied via scp to file /home/scc/systems on the gateway
       scc-srv.

       New systems can be added to the realm via the -u and -m options of scc-
       transfer(1).   This will add dummy, placeholder files that will be used
       by the list option of scc-realm when  specifying	 the  gateway  scc-srv
       which systems to pull data from.



   Performance considerations
       We  tested  scc-update  with many snapshots and scc-rules consumes some
       40% of the time scc-update requires.   When  you	 do  not  require  the
       checks  of  the	rules,	remove	the  configuration  file /var/opt/scc-
       srv/data/www/All/custom/scc-rules.conf to speed up scc-update.  The web
       interface notices the absence of this file and does not show the corre-
       sponding option.

       The programs have been tested with 100, 1000 and	 2000  snapshots.   In
       that  range, there is a linear dependency between the required time and
       the number of systems.


   Display of SCC-data by the web server
       Releases more recent than 1.7.47 support the  program  <A HREF="scc-setup.html">scc-setup(1)</A>  to
       configure  the Apache webserver.	 Call this program without options and
       it will show its defaults.  Inspect these defaults and set  the	corre-
       sponding	 environment  variables	 to  adjust the results of the script.
       Refer to the manual page for more details.  Then call:

	  scc-setup -a

       to activate the web-interface of scc-srv.  This adds the file  scc.conf
       to the apache conf.d directory.	Its default contents are:

	  ScriptAliasMatch "^.*/([^/]*)/cgi-bin/scc-wrapper.cgi" "/var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/$1/cgi-bin/scc-wrapper.cgi"

	  Alias /scc /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www
	  &lt;Directory "/var/opt/scc-srv/data/www"&gt;
	     Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI MultiViews
	     AllowOverride AuthConfig
	     Order allow,deny
	     allow from all
	  &lt;/Directory&gt;

       The  apache  webserver  is restarted to activate this configuration The
       ownership of the files and directories in the scc-srv data hierarchy is
       set to the user running the apache webserver.

       Note  that there is no reason to convert an existing scc-srv to the new
       setup.

       To restrict the access  to  the	SCC-data  in  directory	 /var/opt/scc-
       srv/data/www/All, you can use an .htaccess file in this directory.

       Access  to  the	data  is  achieved  by a cgi-script, called by the web
       server.	This script, <A HREF="scc-wrapper.cgi.html">scc-wrapper.cgi(1)</A> is located in the cgi-bin sub-
       directory  of  /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/All  The images, shown in some
       pages, are located in the subdirectory custom.

       For Apache 1.x, the ScriptAliasMatch has to be replaced with:

	  ScriptAlias prefix/All/cgi-bin/scc-wrapper.cgi \
	    /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www/All/cgi-bin/scc-wrapper.cgi
       Where prefix has to be replaced by the  path  under  the	 documentroot.
       This value is also supplied with the -d option of <A HREF="scc-summary.html">scc-summary(1)</A>.  This
       line has to be repeated for each realm you create.

       On a slitaz 2.0 system installing  lighttpd  and	 lighttpd-modules  was
       sufficient to run scc-srv after using <A HREF="scc-setup.html">scc-setup(1)</A>.

       To save space, the SCC-data of a system in a realm consists of symbolic
       links to the realm All.	When you use only one realm ( All ),  you  can
       do  without  the option FollowSymLinks in the configuration-file of the
       web server.

       Note that the data hierarchy of scc-srv is still present	 on  a	system
       after  removing	the  software.	 You  have to remove this hierarchy in
       /var/opt/scc-srv manually.


   AUTHORISATION
       When it is not desirable that all administrators	 have  access  to  the
       SCC-data of all your systems, you can create additional sub-directories
       in /var/opt/scc-srv/data/www These sub-directories are  called  realms.
       Realms  are maintained by means of <A HREF="scc-realm.html">scc-realm(1)</A>.	 This program supports
       the creation of a realm and adding/deleting systems to/from a realm.

       To create a new realm Education and add the systems c012	 and  c014  to
       this realm, use the following command:


	  scc-realm -a -L c012,c014 -c Education

       To  generate  the summaries for this new realm, <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A> is called
       after creating the directory and the links for the SCC-data.  Refer  to
       the  manual page for more detailed description of setting up realms and
       their permissions.

       It is possible to populate realms automatically by means	 of  the  file
       scc-auto-realm.conf  in	the  custom subdirectory of a realm.  Based on
       hostname, OS and domain systems are (de)selected for a realm.  The sys-
       tems  in	 the  All  realm are the base for this process.	 Refer to scc-
       update(1) for more details.

       You have to edit the file Education/.htaccess to restrict access to the
       Eduction realm.

       When  you followed all the steps mentioned before in this document, you
       should be able to see the start-page of SCC.  Use the path  you	speci-
       fied with the WWW_PATH environment variable determined by <A HREF="scc-setup.html">scc-setup(1)</A>.

       This start-page allows access to the realm All and to the documentation
       of scc-srv.  Note that new realms that are  created  with  <A HREF="scc-realm.html">scc-realm(1)</A>
       are  only added automatically to this page as long as a specific marker
       is preserved in the file index.html.

       You are now ready to run a scc-client and transfer data to the  server.
       Choose  a  client-system	 and  a transfer-option and run scc.  Then run
       <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A> on the server to transfer the data to the web-server  and
       to generate summaries.  When all the above steps have been followed, no
       options need to be specified.

       Use the -A option of <A HREF="scc-realm.html">scc-realm(1)</A> to archive (part of) a realm.	 With-
       out  the	 -w  option, no html files are archived and only snapshots and
       logbooks are copied.  Combining these files with tar and compression is
       not part of the software.  When the -w option is used, a minimal webin-
       terface is provided by <A HREF="scc-summary.html">scc-summary(1)</A> in the specified directory.  Pro-
       viding  and  limiting access to the archive directory is not handled in
       the software and left to the administrators.

       When system foo is no longer in use and you need to  archive  its  data
       for  compliancy,	 you  can  archive the data and then remove the system
       from the webinterface by means of one command:

	  scc-realm -A /path_to_archive -d -L foo All

       Replication and duplication have not been built into the software,  use
       rsync  to  achive  this.	 Another option is to transfer the data to two
       different scc-srv sites.	 When you are using <A HREF="scc-pull.html">scc-pull(1)</A> to collect and
       transfer	 the  data,  use  the -k option on the first call to make sure
       that the clients preserve the data.  On the  second  run,  use  the  -n
       option  to  avoid  that	the  clients collect the data again.  When the
       clients push the data to the server, you have to schedule scc twice  on
       the clients and use the -n option for the second invocation.


   SECURITY
       The  server  receives  SCC-data from clients by email, scp, ftp, rcp or
       cp.  A Denial Of Service is possible by frequently sending large	 snap-
       shots  of  fake	hosts  to  the	SCC  server.   Furthermore, anyone can
       (re)send SCC-data from any system to the SCC  server.   Therefore,  the
       SCC server should only be deployed in a trusted network.

       When the client sends its data using email via the internet, the sensi-
       tive data should be encrypted.  This is achieved by generating  a  pair
       of public/private keys on the server.  The clients encrypt the SCC-data
       using DES3 with random pass phrase.  The pass phrase is encrypted using
       RSA  with  the  public  key  of	the  server.  The server receives both
       encrypted files and uses its private key	 to  obtain  the  random  pass
       phrase  used  by	 the  client.	Finally,  this	pass phrase is used to
       decrypt the SCC-data.  To generate the keys on the server, use the fol-
       lowing commands:

	  # cd /var/opt/scc-srv
	  # umask 077
	  # mkdir encryption
	  # cd encryption
	  # openssl genrsa -out private_key 2048
	  Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
	  .................+++
	  .........................................................+++
	  e is 65537 (0x10001)
	  # openssl rsa -in private_key -out public_key -pubout
	  read RSA key
	  writing RSA key
	  # ls -l
	  total 16
	  -rw-	1 root	   sys	     1679 Sep 29 08:51 private_key
	  -rw-	1 root	   sys	      451 Sep 29 08:52 public_key


       The  file public_key should be transferred to the SCC-client.  The path
       of the file private_key should  be  added  to  the  file	 /var/opt/scc-
       srv/conf/scc.conf with the following keyword:

       SCC_PRIV_HOST_KEY=/var/opt/scc-srv/encryption/private_key


       After   transferring   the   public   key   to	the   client  in  file
       /var/opt/scc/encryption/public_key the data can be encrypted  and  sent
       with the command:

       /opt/scc/bin/scc			       \
	    -k /var/opt/scc/data/encryption/public_key	 \
	    -s scc-transfer@srv.dom


       When  the client cannot use a mail-client, use the -i and -p options to
       send the data via SMTP.	Refer to the  manual  page  of	scc  for  more
       details.


   TROUBLESHOOTING
       First  of  all,	check the URL you are using to display the data.  This
       should correspond with the path you specified (once) with the -d option
       of <A HREF="scc-update.html">scc-update(1)</A>.

       When  the  data	of  a  scc-client  does not show up, you can check the
       directories under /var/opt/scc-srv/data/transfer whether the  raw  data
       arrived.	  Also	check any possible errors reported by the clients when
       sending the data.  <A HREF="scc-transfer.html">scc-transfer(1)</A>  logs	 its  actions  when  the  file
       /var/opt/scc-srv/data/log/scc-transfer.log  exists.   Create  this file
       and try to send the data again.

       The log files of the web server can also be checked.  When  the	start-
       page  of	 SCC and the start-page of the realm All show up, but the cgi-
       script does  not	 function  correctly,  check  the  file	 /var/opt/scc-
       srv/data/log/scc.cgi.log.   <A HREF="scc.cgi.html">scc.cgi(1)</A>  logs  its  actions in this file
       when it exists and is writable by  the  user  running  the  web-server.
       Create this file and try to access the URL again.

       A  restrictive  selinux	can also avoid the display of SCC-data.	 Check
       the appropriate logfile to find out  whether  selinux  is  causing  the
       problems.

       You can also use the program <A HREF="scc-debug.html">scc-debug(1)</A> to obtain additional informa-
       tion concerning scc-srv.

       When this does not give any clues, you can  edit	 the  cgi-scripts  and
       trace  their  execution.	  Add  the following to the start of scc-wrap-
       per.cgi or scc.cgi:

	  exec 2&gt;/tmp/scc-log
	  set -x

       On abnormal termination of a run of a scc-client, the snapshot will not
       be  complete and the next run will produce huge differences.  To remove
       these differences, you have to edit the log file on the client.


   DEPENDENCIES
       The clients of SCC try to use gzip or compress to reduce the amount  of
       data  sent to the server.  This means that the server has to be able to
       access both gunzip and uncompress.  To install  uncompress  on  RedHat,
       install ncompress.

       The  SCC-data  that  is	sent by email, is uuencoded.  The server needs
       uudecode.  To install uudecode on RedHat, install shar-utils.

<H2> CLASS</H2>
<PRE>
       A class-file contains lines with (parts of) classifications.  When they
       are not present, colons are added in front and at the end of each clas-
       sification.  Lines starting with "#" are treated as comments.

       To extract the boot configuration and start/stop links out a  snapshot,
       use the following class-file:

	  boot:config:
	  boot:rc-file:

       Class-files  are	 used  by <A HREF="scc-baseline.html">scc-baseline(1)</A> and <A HREF="scc-syscmp.html">scc-syscmp(1)</A>. Check the
       snapshots to determine the classifications to be extracted.
